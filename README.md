# hello-world
This is my first repository. I'm a baby programmer.

My name is Mike and I like to learn. 
Here I am learning about programming and wondering why this is the font that serious programming stuff is done in.
I wonder what else I will learn today from my new friends Ness and Bjorn.
I wonder if Git, and Tower and PHPStorm will be my friends and teach me new things too.
